    "A regular expression is a sequence of characters that describes a search pattern. In practice, we say that certain strings match a regular expression if the pattern can be found anywhere within those strings (as a substring). The simplest example of regular expressions is an ordinary sequence of characters. Any string that contains that sequence of characters, all adjacent and in the proper order, is said to match that regular expression. \n",

    "There are a number of special characters we can use in regular expressions, and they all change the way a pattern is interpretted. In Python, we use the re (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) module to work with regular expressions.\n",

    "The special character \".\" is used to indicate that any character can be put in its place. Here are a few examples:\n",

    "Let's return to our example from the beginning of our mission. Suppose we need to extract years from strings. An intuitive way to do so would be to match any string that contains four consecutive integers. We can indicate integers in a pattern using square brackets (\"[\" and \"]\") along with a dash (\"-\"). \"[0-9]\" matches any character that falls between 0 and 9, which is all 1-digit integers. Similarly, \"[a-z]\" would match any lowercase letter. We can also do smaller ranges, like \"[3-5]\" or \"[d-g]\".\n",
