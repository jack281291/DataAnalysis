    "The Jupyter console, formerly known as IPython, is an enhanced Python interpreter. From our earlier missions, you may recall that by typing python on the command line, you get access to an interactive shell that lets you write and execute Python code. Jupyter console enhances this shell, and adds several niceties that make working with data easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, it's useful to use the shell in situations where you need to quickly test some code you're writing. This happens frequently when you're writing data analysis scripts. It can also be used to quickly explore datasets and do basic analysis. Another use case is prototyping code before later saving it to a script file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Jupyter console and Jupyter notebook is that the console functions in interactive mode. Whenever you type a line of code, it is immediately executed, and you can see the results. If you want to write medium-length pieces of code or do deep exploration of a dataset, the notebook is better. If you want to test out code you're writing, or run quick commands, the console is better.\n",
